so this is my final project for the class it is definitely not completed i struggled on the database which which doesnt even work properly i believe i couldve done more with the project which i will on me own time so i can fully flesh out the project 

what i did upload to the repository is a page that i created in which took inspiration of a website  called goodreads which is like a massive catalog of books that people have read and given their rating 
i was going to do the same thing but definitely geared towards comic books and graphic novels where someone couldve signed in and saved the books theyve read and have a wishlist for books they want or are looking for.

the languages i used on this page was html / css and js
